// remembered (the @remember command or natural language), the launch hooks append

// well-formed store commit instead of a loose markdown note. Detection is
// deterministic (no model) and lives here so every face shares it.

# CAPTURE REQUESTED — write it to the store
You were asked to REMEMBER something. Commit it to the project store (NOT a markdown file):

    projx-engine store commit --kind <kind> --key <area>/<feature>/<subsystem> --body "<the fact>"

- KIND: ` + "`doc`" + ` (subsystem note), ` + "`adr`" + ` (a decision + why), ` + "`convention`" + ` (a rule to follow), ` + "`history`" + ` (an event).
- KEY: a lowercase path, e.g. ` + "`minecraft/login/backend`" + ` — group related knowledge under a shared prefix.
- If it points at code, put a file anchor in the body JSON: ` + "`{\"note\":\"…\",\"anchor\":\"internal/auth/login.go:42\"}`" + `.
- One commit = one fact. Do NOT write it to README/CLAUDE.md — they are not read.`
