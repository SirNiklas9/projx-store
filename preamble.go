// protocol the agent must follow (read-before-act, commit-on-learn, gate is law)

// construction — the WASM cell (brain), and any native consumer — rather than
// each re-implementing it. Pure and read-only (List only); never mutates.
//
// Delivery (writing it to a file / env var) is the caller's concern; this
// function only produces the text.

project knowledge and your binding contract. It replaces README/CLAUDE.md/any
loose .md for what is true about this project. Operate by these rules — they are
not suggestions; ProjX enforces them externally (a gate denies off-limits
actions, and an isolated verify-gate rejects any change that violates the store
before it can land):

1. READ BEFORE ACTING. The store contents below are already loaded — you know
   them now. Before doing anything, check whether the store already declares a
   convention, decision, or boundary that governs it, and follow it.
2. KNOWLEDGE IN = THE STORE. When you need to know something about this project,
   it is in the store (below, or via the store.query tool). Do not rely on or
   author loose .md files for project knowledge — they are not authoritative and
   not read. Some items below are shown as an INDEX (id + one-line summary) to
   save context tokens — to load any item's full content on demand run
   ` + "`projx-engine store get <id>`" + ` (or search with ` + "`store query`" + `);
   do not assume the summary is the whole thing.
3. KNOWLEDGE OUT = store.commit. When you learn, decide, or mark something down
   (a convention, an ADR, a doc, a history entry), commit it to the store via
   the store.commit tool. One commit after another — that IS the project's
   versioned history. Do not write it to a markdown file.
4. OFF-LIMITS IS LAW. The OFF-LIMITS section lists paths you must not read,
   edit, or run against. This is enforced, not requested: attempts are denied,
   and any change touching them is rejected by the verify-gate. Don't try.
5. YOU WORK IN ISOLATION. Your changes do not land directly. ProjX runs your
   diff through projx-verify and the gate; only a clean diff is accepted. Write
   code that conforms to the store and it lands; violate it and it bounces back.`
